# data
## data is a collection of raw data

# structure
## it is a way of organizing

# Algorithms
## Aa step by step procedure for sloving a problem

# DSA
## these are actually an essential way to organize and store data efficently in computer

# Why to learn DSA?
## to acheive problem solving skills
## Building scalable solution in web and app
## interview preparation

# Types of data

## primitve data types
## non -primitve data types
### primitive data types" refer to basic, built-in data types like integers, characters, and booleans that directly store their values in memory, while "non-primitive data types" are more complex structures like arrays, objects, and strings which store a reference to the data's location in memory, allowing for more complex manipulation and mutability


# Most common data structure
## Array 
## hashmaps/key value pairs
## lnkedlist
## stack
## qeue
## tree graphs

# Array DSA
## array is linear data structure. It is a collection of different types of data

# Why we use store arrays DSA?
## due to store multiple data in the single array

# How to access elements in an array?
## Every element of an array can accessed through its index. Index of array always starts with 0 and ends at N-1.

# Types of Arrays
## Arrays can be categorized into different types:
## One dimensional array
## Two dimensional array
## Three dimensional array
