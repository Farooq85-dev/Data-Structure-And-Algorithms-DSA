// how does file system stores its data
// every folders have so many files and folders
// and then that folder or file have many folders and files
// this creates a tree like structure
// where ther parent children data structure you can use Tree data structure

// Tree data structure is a non-linear data structure
// stack, qeue, are linear data structure

// every node has parent except root element
// each subtree of node is itself a tree

// types of trees

// binary tree
// each node has exactly two children (left and right)

// binary search tree
// each node child has also eactly two nodes
// also left child < parent
// also right > parent

// avl tree
// self balancing search tree
// diference between the height of left and right subtree of any node must be between 1 and -1.

// trie tree
// special tree for storing strings
// useful for autocomplete, spell checking and prefix based searching

// N-ary tree
// node have more than two childrens
// example like file system etc.

// where to use tree data structure

// file system
// networking
// DOM
// databases
